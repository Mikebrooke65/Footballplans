# STEP_1_SETUP.md

Initial project setup and folder scaffolding instructions for the West Coast Rangers Junior Coaching App (built in .NET MAUI using Visual Studio 2022). This step establishes structure, planning docs, sample data, and key stub files.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Align repo structure with build plan and design principles, ensuring clarity for contributors and seamless implementation of coaching tools, Markdown previews, session flow, and audit tracking.

---

## ✅ 1. Create .NET MAUI Solution

- Open Visual Studio 2022
- Choose: `Create a new project > .NET MAUI App`
- Name it: `FootballCoachApp`
- Ensure shared project folder is created as root working directory

---

## 📁 2. Add Project Folders

Inside the shared MAUI project, use Solution Explorer:

- Right-click → `Add > New Folder` and create:
  - `/Views/`
  - `/Views/Admin/`
  - `/ViewModels/`
  - `/Controls/`
  - `/Models/`
  - `/Services/`
  - `/sample_data/`
  - `/build/`
  - (Optional) `/docs/` for contributor formatting guides

---

## 📝 3. Create Planning Files

In `/build/`:

- Add:
  - `BUILD_PLAN.md` → implementation phases
  - `PrepChecklist.md` → setup steps
  - `STEP_1_SETUP.md` → this file
- Inside `/DesignPrinciples/` add:
  - `Markdown.md` → contributor formatting expectations

---

## 🧪 4. Stub Views and ViewModels

In `/Views/`, create:

```plaintext
LessonBuilder.xaml
LessonBuilder.xaml.cs
TextBlockEditor.xaml
TextBlockEditor.xaml.cs
SkillSelectPage.xaml
SessionStart.xaml
SessionStart.xaml.cs
HomePage.xaml
