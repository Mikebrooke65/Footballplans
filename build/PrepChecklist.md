# PREP_CHECKLIST.md

Pre-build preparation checklist for the West Coast Rangers Junior Coaching App (MAUI version). Complements `BUILD_PLAN.md` and ensures repo, tooling, and sample content are aligned before implementation begins.

## âœ… 1. Repo Structure & Scaffolding

- [ ] Folder layout matches MAUI build phases:
  - `/Views/` for screens (e.g. LessonBuilder, SessionStart)
  - `/ViewModels/` if using MVVM pattern
  - `/Controls/` for reusable UI (e.g. MarkdownRenderer)
  - `/Admin/` or `/Views/Admin/` for audit pages
  - `/build/` for planning docs
  - `/sample_data/` for mock records
- [ ] `BUILD_PLAN.md` and `DesignPrinciples.md` in `/build/`
- [ ] Stub views created as `.xaml` and `.xaml.cs`:
  - `LessonBuilder.xaml`
  - `TextBlockEditor.xaml`
  - `SkillSelectPage.xaml`
  - `SessionStart.xaml`
  - `AuditTrailViewer.xaml`
- [ ] VS2022 solution updated with scoped projects or folders per target

## âœ… 2. Sample Records

- [ ] Add sample `CoachTextBlocks` (Markdown examples: bold, bullets, breaks)
- [ ] Add sample `Lessons` with realistic content
- [ ] Store samples in `/sample_data/`
- [ ] Use sample records in docs and test harnesses

---

## âœ… 4. Test Harness & Validation
